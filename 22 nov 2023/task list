Objective: Understand fundamental concepts of Python syntax.

1. Variables:
   - Define five different variables showcasing various data types (integers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries).
   - Print each variable along with its data type.

2. Data Types:
   - Define and explain different data types available in Python (int, float, str, list, tuple, dict).
   - Provide an example for each data type showcasing its usage.

3. Conditional Statements:
   - Implement an `if...else` statement to check whether a number is even or odd.
   - Use the modulo operator `%` to perform this check.

4. Loops:
   - Create a `for` loop that iterates through a list of numbers (e.g., 1 to 10).
   - Print each number in the loop.

5. Functions:
   - Define a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum.
   - Demonstrate the function by calling it with different sets of arguments.
