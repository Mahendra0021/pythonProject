1. Advanced Data Structures:

a. Lists:

In-depth Exploration: Lists are versatile in Python, supporting various data types and nested structures. Advanced indexing, slicing, and comprehension techniques can be applied.

Example:

matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flattened = [num for row in matrix for num in row]
print("Flattened Matrix:", flattened)

Use Cases and Applications: Lists are commonly used for managing sequential data, such as time series or collections of similar objects.

b. Sets:

In-depth Exploration: Sets provide unique elements with efficient membership tests. Advanced operations like union, intersection, and difference can be performed.

Example:

set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
intersection_result = set1.intersection(set2)
print("Intersection of Sets:", intersection_result)

Use Cases and Applications: Sets are beneficial for tasks like eliminating duplicates from a collection or checking for common elements between datasets.

c. Dictionaries:

In-depth Exploration: Dictionaries allow key-value pair storage. Advanced techniques include dictionary comprehension and handling nested dictionaries.

Example:

student_data = {"Name": "Alice", "Age": 20, "Grades": {"Math": 90, "English": 85}}
average_grade = sum(student_data["Grades"].values()) / len(student_data["Grades"])
print("Average Grade:", average_grade)

Use Cases and Applications: Dictionaries are crucial for representing structured data, like configurations, user profiles, or JSON-like data.
