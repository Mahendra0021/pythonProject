2. File I/O:
File Handling in Python: Python provides functions like open(), read(), write(), and close() for handling files.

Example (Reading from a Text File):

with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("File Content:", content)

Handling Different File Formats:

CSV:

import csv
with open("data.csv", "r") as csvfile:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
    for row in csv_reader:
        print(row)
JSON:

import json
with open("data.json", "r") as jsonfile:
    data = json.load(jsonfile)
    print("JSON Data:", data)
